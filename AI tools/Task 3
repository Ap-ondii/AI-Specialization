 PART 3: NLP with spaCy (Amazon Reviews)

import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Sample reviews (you can replace with real Amazon reviews)
reviews = [
    "I love my new Apple iPhone 14! The camera quality is amazing.",
    "Samsung's Galaxy Buds are decent, but not great for the price.",
    "Avoid this product. Terrible quality from BrandX."
]

# Rule-based sentiment keywords
positive_words = ["love", "amazing", "great"]
negative_words = ["terrible", "avoid", "bad"]

# Run NER and sentiment analysis
for review in reviews:
    doc = nlp(review)
    print(f"\nReview: {review}")
    print("Entities:")
    for ent in doc.ents:
        print(f" - {ent.text} ({ent.label_})")

    sentiment = "Neutral"
    if any(word in review.lower() for word in positive_words):
        sentiment = "Positive"
    elif any(word in review.lower() for word in negative_words):
        sentiment = "Negative"
    print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment}")
